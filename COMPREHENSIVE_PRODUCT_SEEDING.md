php artisan db:seed --class=TestProductSeeder
```

### Running Complete Database Seeding
```bash
php artisan db:seed
```

## File Structure

```
database/seeders/
├── ComprehensiveProductSeeder.php    # Main comprehensive seeder
├── TestProductSeeder.php             # Limited test seeder
└── DatabaseSeeder.php                # Updated to use comprehensive seeder
```

## Expected Results

After running the comprehensive seeder, you should have:

- **140+ Products**: 2-3 products per category (70 categories)
- **400+ Color Variants**: Multiple colors per product with images
- **500+ Size Variants**: Appropriate sizes for each category
- **1000+ Color-Size Combinations**: Full matrix of variants
- **500+ Specifications**: Detailed product information
- **All Images Downloaded**: Local storage of all product and variant images

## Performance Considerations

- **Image Downloads**: May take time due to Unsplash API calls
- **Database Operations**: Bulk inserts for efficiency
- **Memory Usage**: Optimized for large datasets
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for failed operations

## Customization

### Adding New Categories
1. Add category to the product templates in `getProductTemplatesForCategory()`
2. Define appropriate colors in `getColorsForCategory()`
3. Set variant requirements in `categoryRequiresVariants()`

### Modifying Color Palettes
Update the color arrays in `getColorsForCategory()` method

### Adjusting Size Ranges
Modify the size selection logic in `getSizesForCategory()` methods

### Custom Specifications
Add category-specific specifications in the product templates

## Troubleshooting

### Image Download Issues

- Verify Unsplash API availability
- Check file permissions for image directories

### Size Category Issues
- Ensure size categories are seeded first
- Run `SizeCategoriesSeeder` before product seeding

### Database Constraints
- Ensure all foreign key relationships exist
- Check branch and category data before seeding

## Integration with Existing System

The seeder integrates seamlessly with:
- ✅ Existing category structure
- ✅ Branch management system
- ✅ Size category system
