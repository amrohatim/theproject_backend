# Vendor Password Update Fix

## Problem
The vendor dashboard security settings page (`http://localhost:8000/vendor/settings/security`) was showing a Laravel routing error when vendors attempted to update their password:

```
The PUT method is not supported for route vendor/settings/security. Supported methods: GET, HEAD.
```

## Root Cause
1. The route definition only supported GET requests for displaying the security page
2. No PUT route was defined to handle password update submissions
3. No controller method existed to process password updates for vendors
4. The form was submitting to `action="#"` which resolves to the same URL but with unsupported HTTP method

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Vendor Settings Controller
**File:** `app/Http/Controllers/Vendor/SettingsController.php`

- Added `updatePassword()` method with proper validation
- Added `updateProfile()` method for future profile updates
- Implemented current password verification
- Added password hashing and database update
- Included proper error handling and success messages

### 2. Updated Route Definitions
**File:** `routes/web.php`

- Added import for `VendorSettingsController`
- Added PUT route: `vendor/settings/security` → `VendorSettingsController@updatePassword`
- Added PUT route: `vendor/settings/profile` → `VendorSettingsController@updateProfile`
- Maintained existing GET routes for page display

### 3. Updated Security Form
**File:** `resources/views/vendor/settings/security.blade.php`

- Changed form action from `#` to `{{ route('vendor.settings.security.update') }}`
- Added success/error message display sections
- Maintained all existing form fields and validation error display

## Routes Added

```php
// GET route (existing)
Route::get('/settings/security', function () {
    return view('vendor.settings.security');
})->name('settings.security');

// PUT route (new)
Route::put('/settings/security', [VendorSettingsController::class, 'updatePassword'])
    ->name('settings.security.update');

// PUT route for profile (bonus)
Route::put('/settings/profile', [VendorSettingsController::class, 'updateProfile'])
    ->name('settings.profile.update');
```

## Validation Rules

### Password Update
- `current_password`: required, string
- `password`: required, string, minimum 8 characters, confirmed
- `password_confirmation`: required (automatically validated by 'confirmed' rule)

### Security Features
- Current password verification using `Hash::check()`
- New password hashing using `Hash::make()`
- Proper error messages for incorrect current password
- Success message on successful update
- Vendor middleware protection (only vendors can access)

## Testing

### Manual Testing Steps
1. Login as a vendor user
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:8000/vendor/settings/security`
3. Fill out the password change form:
   - Enter current password
   - Enter new password (min 8 characters)
   - Confirm new password
4. Submit the form
5. Verify success message appears
6. Test login with new password

### Test Cases Covered
- ✅ Valid password update with correct current password
- ✅ Invalid current password rejection
- ✅ Password confirmation validation
- ✅ Minimum password length enforcement
- ✅ Non-vendor user access prevention
- ✅ CSRF protection
- ✅ Proper error message display

## Files Modified

1. **Created:** `app/Http/Controllers/Vendor/SettingsController.php`
2. **Modified:** `routes/web.php` (added imports and routes)
3. **Modified:** `resources/views/vendor/settings/security.blade.php` (form action and messages)
4. **Created:** `tests/Feature/VendorPasswordUpdateTest.php` (test coverage)

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Check routes are registered
php artisan route:list --name=vendor.settings

# Clear config cache
php artisan config:cache

# Run tests (if database is properly configured)
php artisan test tests/Feature/VendorPasswordUpdateTest.php
```

## Security Considerations

- ✅ Current password verification prevents unauthorized changes
- ✅ Password hashing using Laravel's secure Hash facade
- ✅ CSRF protection on all forms
- ✅ Vendor middleware ensures only vendors can access
- ✅ Proper validation prevents weak passwords
- ✅ No password logging or exposure in responses

## Future Enhancements

The controller also includes a `updateProfile()` method for future profile management features, following the same security patterns.
