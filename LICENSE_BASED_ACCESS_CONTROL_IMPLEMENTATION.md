# License-Based Access Control Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of a license-based access control system for providers, replacing the previous registration_status-based system. The new system checks the provider's license status from the `licenses` table to determine access permissions.

## Implementation Summary

### ✅ Completed Components

#### 1. User Model Updates (`app/Models/User.php`)
- Added `licenses()` relationship method
- Added `activeLicense()` relationship method  
- Added `latestLicense()` relationship method
- Added `hasActiveLicense()` helper method
- Added `getLicenseStatus()` helper method
- Added `hasLicense()` helper method

#### 2. ProviderMiddleware Updates (`app/Http/Middleware/ProviderMiddleware.php`)
- Replaced `registration_status` checks with license-based logic
- Added redirect to license upload for providers without licenses
- Added license status checking with appropriate redirects:
  - **No license**: Redirect to `provider.license.upload`
  - **Pending license**: Redirect to `provider.license.status`
  - **Expired license**: Redirect to `provider.license.upload`
  - **Rejected license**: Redirect to `provider.license.upload`
  - **Active license**: Allow access to provider dashboard

#### 3. Controller Methods (`app/Http/Controllers/Web/RegistrationController.php`)
- `showProviderLicenseUpload()` - Display license upload form
- `showProviderLicenseStatus()` - Display license status page
- `submitProviderLicenseUpload()` - Handle license upload submission

#### 4. Routes (`routes/web.php`)
- `GET /provider/license/upload` → `provider.license.upload`
- `POST /provider/license/upload` → `provider.license.upload.submit`
- `GET /provider/license/status` → `provider.license.status`

#### 5. Views
- `resources/views/auth/provider/license-upload-standalone.blade.php` - License upload form
- `resources/views/auth/provider/license-status.blade.php` - License status display
- Updated `resources/views/auth/provider/registration-status.blade.php` - Now shows license-based status

#### 6. Service Updates (`app/Services/RegistrationService.php`)
- Modified `completeProviderLicense()` to accept license status parameter
- Supports setting license status to 'pending' for admin review

## License Status Flow

### Provider Access Scenarios

1. **Provider with Active License**
   - ✅ Can access provider dashboard normally
   - ✅ All provider features available

2. **Provider with Pending License**
   - 🔄 Redirected to license status page
   - 📄 Shows "License Under Review" message
   - ⏰ Auto-refreshes every 30 seconds

3. **Provider with Expired License**
   - ❌ Redirected to license upload page
   - 📄 Shows "License Expired" message
   - 🔄 Must upload renewed license

4. **Provider with Rejected License**
   - ❌ Redirected to license upload page
   - 📄 Shows "License Rejected" message
   - 🔄 Can upload new/corrected license

5. **Provider without License Record**
   - ❌ Redirected to license upload page
   - 📄 Shows "License Required" message
   - 📤 Must upload initial license

## Database Schema

The system uses the existing `licenses` table with the following status values:
- `active` - License is valid and provider can access dashboard
- `pending` - License is under admin review
- `expired` - License has expired and needs renewal
- `rejected` - License was rejected by admin

## Testing

### Automated Tests Completed
- ✅ User model method verification
- ✅ License model method verification
- ✅ Middleware logic verification
- ✅ Route registration verification
- ✅ Controller method verification
- ✅ View file syntax verification
- ✅ Database schema compatibility

### Manual Testing Recommendations
1. Create provider user without license → Verify redirect to upload
2. Upload license → Verify pending status assignment
3. Admin approve/reject license → Verify status updates
4. Test expired license handling
5. Verify dashboard access with active license

## Key Benefits

1. **Granular Control**: License status provides more specific access control
2. **Admin Oversight**: All licenses require admin approval (pending status)
3. **Automatic Expiry**: System can handle license expiration
4. **Clear User Feedback**: Users see specific messages based on license status
5. **Flexible Workflow**: Supports reapplication after rejection

## Migration Notes

- No database migration required (uses existing `licenses` table)
- Existing providers will need to upload licenses to access dashboard
- Previous `registration_status` field is no longer used for provider access control

## Files Modified

1. `app/Models/User.php` - Added license relationships and helper methods
2. `app/Http/Middleware/ProviderMiddleware.php` - License-based access control
3. `app/Http/Controllers/Web/RegistrationController.php` - New license management methods
4. `app/Services/RegistrationService.php` - Support for pending license status
5. `routes/web.php` - New license management routes
6. `resources/views/auth/provider/registration-status.blade.php` - License-based UI

## Files Created

1. `resources/views/auth/provider/license-upload-standalone.blade.php`
2. `resources/views/auth/provider/license-status.blade.php`

## Implementation Status: ✅ COMPLETE

All tasks have been successfully implemented and tested. The license-based access control system is ready for production use.
