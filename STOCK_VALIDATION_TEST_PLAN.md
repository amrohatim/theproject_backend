## Test Scenarios

### 1. General Stock (Total Product Stock) Validation

#### Test 1.1: Valid Stock Input
**Objective**: Verify that the total stock field accepts valid numeric values

**Steps**:
1. Navigate to merchant product creation page
2. Wait for Vue.js app to load (loading spinner disappears)
3. Locate the "Total Stock" field in the Basic Info tab
4. Enter a valid positive number (e.g., 100)
5. Verify the value is accepted and displayed

**Expected Result**: 
- ‚úÖ Field accepts the value
- ‚úÖ No validation errors shown
- ‚úÖ Value serves as master stock limit

#### Test 1.2: Negative Stock Prevention
**Objective**: Verify that negative stock values are prevented

**Steps**:
1. Enter a negative value (e.g., -10) in the Total Stock field
2. Tab out or trigger validation

**Expected Result**:
- ‚úÖ Value is either rejected or auto-corrected to 0
- ‚úÖ Appropriate error message or feedback shown

#### Test 1.3: Zero Stock Handling
**Objective**: Verify zero stock is handled correctly

**Steps**:
1. Enter 0 in the Total Stock field
2. Observe behavior

**Expected Result**:
- ‚úÖ Zero value is accepted
- ‚úÖ Color stock allocation should be limited accordingly

### 2. Color Stock Allocation Validation

#### Test 2.1: Add First Color
**Objective**: Verify color addition and stock allocation

**Steps**:
1. Set Total Stock to 100
2. Click "Add First Color" or navigate to Colors & Images tab
3. Add a color variant
4. Set color name (e.g., "Red")
5. Set color stock to 60

**Expected Result**:
- ‚úÖ Color is added successfully
- ‚úÖ Stock allocation is within total stock limit
- ‚úÖ Stock summary appears showing allocation

#### Test 2.2: Stock Allocation Summary Display
**Objective**: Verify stock allocation summary shows correct information

**Steps**:
1. After adding a color with stock, locate the "Stock Allocation Summary" section
2. Verify the following elements are present and accurate:
   - Total Stock: 100
   - Allocated Stock: 60
   - Remaining Stock: 40
   - Progress bar showing ~60% allocation

**Expected Result**:
- ‚úÖ All summary elements are visible
- ‚úÖ Calculations are correct
- ‚úÖ Progress bar reflects allocation percentage
- ‚úÖ Progress bar color is blue (normal allocation)

#### Test 2.3: Over-Allocation Prevention
**Objective**: Verify that color stock cannot exceed total stock

**Steps**:
1. With Total Stock = 100 and first color = 60
2. Add a second color
3. Try to set second color stock to 50 (total would be 110)

**Expected Result**:
- ‚úÖ Value is auto-corrected to maximum allowed (40)
- ‚úÖ Warning message appears
- ‚úÖ Stock summary shows over-allocation warning
- ‚úÖ Progress bar turns red when over-allocated

#### Test 2.4: Multiple Color Allocation
**Objective**: Test allocation across multiple colors

**Steps**:
1. Set Total Stock to 200
2. Add 3 colors with stocks: 80, 70, 50 (total = 200)
3. Verify all allocations are accepted
4. Try to increase any color stock beyond available

**Expected Result**:
- ‚úÖ Valid allocations are accepted
- ‚úÖ Over-allocation is prevented with auto-correction
- ‚úÖ Stock summary updates in real-time

---

### 3. Size Stock Distribution (Within Colors)

#### Test 3.1: Size Management Visibility
**Objective**: Verify size management appears when color has stock

**Steps**:
1. Add a color with name and stock > 0
2. Look for size management section within the color card

**Expected Result**:
- ‚úÖ Size management section becomes visible
- ‚úÖ "Add Size" button is available
- ‚úÖ Message shows when color needs name and stock

#### Test 3.2: Size Stock Allocation
**Objective**: Test size stock allocation within color limits

**Steps**:
1. Set color stock to 50
2. Add sizes (S, M, L) with stocks: 15, 20, 15 (total = 50)
3. Verify allocations are accepted

**Expected Result**:
- ‚úÖ Size stocks are accepted when within color limit
- ‚úÖ Size stock total cannot exceed color stock
- ‚úÖ Real-time validation feedback

#### Test 3.3: Size Over-Allocation Prevention
**Objective**: Verify size stock cannot exceed color stock

**Steps**:
1. With color stock = 50 and existing size allocations
2. Try to set a size stock that would exceed color limit

**Expected Result**:
- ‚úÖ Over-allocation is prevented
- ‚úÖ Auto-correction occurs
- ‚úÖ Appropriate feedback message shown

---

### 4. Validation Rules and Error Handling

#### Test 4.1: Form Submission Validation
**Objective**: Verify form cannot be submitted with invalid stock allocation

**Steps**:
1. Set up an over-allocation scenario
2. Fill required fields (name, category, price)
3. Attempt to submit the form

**Expected Result**:
- ‚úÖ Form submission is prevented
- ‚úÖ Validation errors are shown
- ‚úÖ User is guided to correct tab
- ‚úÖ Clear error messages displayed

#### Test 4.2: Required Color Validation
**Objective**: Verify at least one color with stock is required

1. Fill basic product info but don't add any colors
2. Attempt to submit

**Expected Result**:
- ‚úÖ Validation error about missing colors
- ‚úÖ User directed to Colors & Images tab

#### Test 4.3: Tab Navigation with Errors
**Objective**: Verify error handling guides user to correct tab

**Steps**:
1. Create validation errors in different tabs
2. Attempt form submission

**Expected Result**:
- ‚úÖ User is automatically switched to tab with errors
- ‚úÖ Error messages are clearly visible
- ‚úÖ Tab indicators show error state
