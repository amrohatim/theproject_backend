# Provider Locations Table Fix

## Issue
The database was missing the `provider_locations` table, which caused the following error when accessing the provider locations page:

```
SQLSTATE[42S02]: Base table or view not found: 1146 Table 'marketplace_windsurf.provider_locations' doesn't exist (Connection: mysql, SQL: select * from `provider_locations` where `provider_id` = 1)
```

## Solution
We created the missing `provider_locations` table with the correct structure and foreign key constraints.

### Steps Taken:
1. Verified that the `provider_profiles` table exists (it does)
2. Created the `provider_locations` table with the following structure:
   - `id` (primary key)
   - `provider_id` (foreign key to provider_profiles.id)
   - `label` (nullable)
   - `emirate`
   - `latitude`
   - `longitude`
   - `created_at`
   - `updated_at`
3. Added a foreign key constraint to ensure referential integrity
4. Added a test record to verify the table works correctly

### Verification
We successfully:
- Created the table
- Added a sample location for a provider
- Queried the table to verify the location was added

## Next Steps
The provider locations feature should now work correctly. You can:
1. Access the provider locations page from the dashboard sidebar
2. Add, edit, and delete locations as needed
3. Use the Google Maps integration to select locations visually

## Additional Information
The issue was caused by a missing migration. The migration file exists (`2024_07_01_000001_create_provider_locations_table.php`) but it wasn't executed properly during the initial database setup.

If you encounter similar issues with other tables in the future, you can use the same approach to fix them.
